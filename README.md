## Bitburner

This code base houses scripts for playing the game bitburner. Additionally, a testing suite for testing that the scripts are behaving as expected is currently being developed.

## vscode-template

For this repo to interact with the game, it uses a variety of tools that can be found in the following link. I have added these files to the gitignore to prevent clutter since these are not the files that are being developed in this repo.
